A calculus learning video game made to help students prepare for the AP Calculus AB exam. 

4 players; keyboard/mouse and gamepad (Xbox controller) input supported.


## Instructions:
  The game will progress in rounds, and each round every player will:
  
 * Answer two questions of varying difficulty to earn points (there is a **right-hand side** scrollbar for the question text/image if it appears to be cut off)
 * Upgrade their rockets using the currency they earned from the prior questions that round or in previous rounds.
 * Launch their rockets (press space or the launch button at the bottom) and repeat the process until someone reaches the Kármán line.
